* Explanations
*ISCC PLUS Add-On (205-01) GHG Emission Requirements implies that every element of the supply chain must 
provide:  
    - GHG emissions (also if disaggregated default values are used)
    - Mode of transportation (not applicable if default value for transport is being used)
    - Transporting distance from supplier to company in kilometers (not applicable if default value is being used)
*SAI Silver: In a benchmark by the SAI Platform the sustainability requirements of ISCC EU and ISCC PLUS have 
been determined as equivalent to FSA Silver level on a global level. This allows ISCC certified system users around 
the world to sell all “ISCC COMPLIANT” products as “Equivalent to FSA 2.0 Silver”.
*SAI Gold: ISCC has developed the voluntary Add-on “SAI Gold”, which can be applied on farm level. The Add-on 
ensures compliance with the FSA Gold level. This allows ISCC certified system users to sell all “ISCC COMPLIANT 
products that also comply with the Add-on “SAI Gold” as “Equivalent to FSA 2.0 Gold”.
*ISCC System Document 202 „Sustainability Requirements“:
    - Protection of Land with High Biodiversity Value or High Carbon Stock
    - Environmentally Responsible Production to Protect Soil, Water and Air
    - Safe Working Conditions,
    - Compliance with Human, Labour and Land Rights
    - Compliance with Laws and International Treaties
    - Good Management Practices and Continuous Improvement
*FEFAC: The European Feed Manufacturers’ Federation (FEFAC) has benchmarked ISCC. ISCC products can be 
sold as “in line with FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines 2015”
*"Raw material" relates to the initial material at the beginning of the supply chain (e.g. circular (including technical-
circular): mixed plastic waste; bio-circular: UCO; bio: corn; renewable: electricity; for further explanation, please see
